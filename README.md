## üìã Data Schema

BlueAnalyze uses the following core data structures:

### BlueSkyUser

```typescript
interface BlueSkyUser {
  did: string;              // Unique user identifier
  handle: string;           // Username (e.g., user.bsky.social)
  displayName?: string;     // Display name
  avatar?: string;          // Profile picture URL
  description?: string;     // Profile description
  indexedAt?: string;       // Indexing date
  followersCount?: number;  // Number of followers
  followsCount?: number;    // Number of following
}
```

### FollowerAnalysisResult

```typescript
interface FollowerAnalysisResult {
  notFollowingBack: BlueSkyUser[];  // Accounts that don't follow you back
  notFollowedBack: BlueSkyUser[];   // Accounts you don't follow back
  mutuals: BlueSkyUser[];           // Mutual follows
  followerCount: number;            // Total number of your followers
  followingCount: number;           // Total number of accounts you follow
}
```

### AuthResponse

```typescript
interface AuthResponse {
  accessJwt: string;        // Access token for API requests
  refreshJwt: string;       // Token used for refreshing
  handle: string;           // Username
  did: string;              // Unique user identifier
  email?: string;           // Email address (if any)
  emailConfirmed?: boolean; // Email confirmation status
}
```

## üîÑ Workflow

BlueAnalyze's operational logic includes the following steps:

1. **Authentication**: User logs in with Bluesky username and App Password
2. **Follower Analysis**: All followers and following are retrieved via API
3. **Analysis Results**: Follow relationships are analyzed and categorized
4. **Operations**: User can perform various actions based on the analysis (unfollow, follow, etc.)

### API Requests

The application uses the Bluesky ATP (AT Protocol) API:

- `app.bsky.graph.getFollowers`: To get followers
- `app.bsky.graph.getFollows`: To get following
- `app.bsky.graph.follow`: To follow a user
- `app.bsky.graph.unfollow`: To unfollow a user
